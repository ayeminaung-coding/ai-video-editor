# Cat Meme Workflow (Shorts / TikTok / Reels)

A simple loop for producing endless faceless cat meme videos.

## 1. Collect Clips
- Record your own cat on phone
- Ask friends/family for clips
- Use free stock sites (Pexels, Pixabay) for generic cat shots

## 2. Find the Joke
- Watch the clip and decide the emotion:
  - Angry cat, lazy cat, zoomies, chaos, etc.
- Use AI writer to brainstorm meme lines:
  - English meme text
  - Burmese reaction text

## 3. Create Voice or Text-Only
- Option A: Voiceover (EN or MM) via Gemini TTS
- Option B: No voice, just strong on-screen text + music

## 4. Edit in AI Video Editor
- Import the clip(s)
- Trim to 10–30 seconds
- Add text overlays:
  - Top: main meme line (often English)
  - Bottom: reaction line (often Burmese)
- Adjust speed/zoom to emphasize funny moments.

## 5. Add Music & SFX
- Use copyright-free tracks (YouTube Audio Library, Pixabay Music)
- Add simple sound effects (meow, bonk, vine boom, etc.) if you like

## 6. Subtitles (Optional)
- For short meme clips, big text overlays can act as subtitles
- If you use voiceover, auto-caption and keep text large and readable

## 7. Export & Upload Everywhere
- Export one vertical MP4 (1080x1920)
- Upload the same file to:
  - TikTok (caption: Eng + MM mix + emojis)
  - YouTube Shorts (caption mainly English)
  - Facebook Reels (caption mainly Burmese)

## 8. Batch Production
- Work in batches:
  - 1 day = script + edit + export 5–10 clips
  - Schedule uploads over the week

Cat memes are perfect for fast, repeated content. The goal is low friction: same simple workflow, many clips.
