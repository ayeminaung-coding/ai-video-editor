# Movie Recap Workflow (Shorts / TikTok / Reels)

End-to-end flow for one movie recap video.

## 1. Pick Movie & Angle
- Choose a movie (or episode)
- Decide the angle:
  - Full story in 60s
  - Ending explained
  - “What you missed” breakdown

## 2. Generate Scripts (EN + MM)
- Use AI writer (ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini):
  - English script (YouTube Shorts focus)
  - Burmese version (TikTok/Reels focus)
- Keep structure:
  - Hook
  - Setup
  - Conflict / twist
  - Payoff / lesson / tease next part

## 3. Create Voiceover
- For English:
  - Paste EN script into Gemini TTS → export audio (MP3/WAV)
- For Burmese:
  - Either MM TTS in Gemini, or record your own voice

## 4. Collect Visuals
- Movie clips (short scenes, heavily edited) or
- Stock footage + overlays if you don’t want to touch copyrighted video
- Make sure to:
  - Crop to 9:16
  - Add zoom, cuts, text, filters so it feels original

## 5. Edit in AI Video Editor
- Upload base video (or clips)
- Import voiceover audio
- Use controls:
  - Trim to 30–90 seconds
  - Speed adjustments
  - Brightness / contrast
  - Text overlays (titles, key lines)
- Aim for 9:16 vertical layout.

## 6. Subtitles
- Use auto-caption tool (CapCut or Whisper-based):
  - For Shorts: EN main subtitles, small MM line if needed
  - For TikTok/FB: MM main subtitles, EN phrases as flavor
- Burn subtitles into the video or export as SRT and re-import.

## 7. Export
- Resolution: 1080x1920 (Full HD vertical)
- Format: MP4
- FPS: 30 (60 only if you really need it)

## 8. Upload to Platforms
- YouTube Shorts:
  - English title + hook
  - Description + a couple of hashtags
- TikTok:
  - EN + MM mixed caption
  - Hashtags: movie name, #movierecap, #myanmar, etc.
- Facebook Reels:
  - Caption more Burmese-heavy, same video file

## 9. Track Performance
- Log into a Notion page or Google Sheet:
  - Date, movie, title, duration
  - Platforms posted to
  - Views, watch time, likes/comments

Repeat the same workflow for sequels/parts so your process becomes fast and repeatable.
