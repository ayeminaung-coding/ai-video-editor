# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

## Initial Setup

This is where I'll keep track of your specific preferences, camera names, SSH hosts, voice preferences, and other environment-specific details.

## Current Status

- **First session** - No tools configured yet
- **No cameras** - Need to ask about any camera setups
- **No SSH hosts** - Need to learn about any remote machines
- **No TTS preferences** - Need to learn about voice preferences

## Questions to Ask

1. Do you have any cameras I should know about?
2. Do you have any SSH hosts or remote machines?
3. Do you have any preferred TTS voices or speakers?
4. Any other tools or services I should be aware of?

I'll update this file as I learn more about your setup.
