## First Session Questions

To help me get to know you better, here are some questions I'd love to know:

1. **What should I call you?** (Your name, nickname, or just "you" is fine)
2. **What timezone are you in?** (So I can be mindful of your schedule)
3. **What are you working on right now?** (Projects, work, hobbies - anything that matters to you)
4. **How do you like to communicate?** (Direct and concise? Detailed and thorough? Casual or formal?)
5. **What's your risk tolerance?** (Do you like things locked down tight, or prefer convenience over security?)
6. **Any specific tools or services you use regularly?** (Cameras, SSH hosts, smart home devices, etc.)
7. **What makes you laugh?** (So I can be fun when appropriate)
8. **What annoys you?** (So I can avoid doing that)

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
